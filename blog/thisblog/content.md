# About this blog

**Dated**: 2024/07/01

I've not written a blog post in a while now (on my own blog at least); my old one was long overdue an
'update'. I'm downgrading all the tech it used and go back to simple things I can actually understand.

I think I started my first blog on blogspot or wordpress, but it's now lost to me and the internet.
It didn't also have anything substatial, except for this one article I wrote in my teenage years about
becoming an athiest(or was it agnostic?) that one friend from IRC still recalls sometimes. (hi LjL).
Other than that there were several comics I drew in paint.exe depicting stupid puns.

The next blog/website that I started was made when I started working at my first job. It's still up for
a while until I feel okay replacing it (it'll remain archived). I posted some what I now can see are
not-so-important posts on it, some about random technical topics I was either working on, or interested in.
This ran from around 2012 to 2016 - and in this period I also created (or collaborated) on a couple of
small wikis. One of them was a mediawiki hosted for free somewhere (now non functional, and no backups,
but there's archives) about Open source hardware - it was more of a database of vendors, projects, people
(public profiles), tools/software etc. that would be interesting to people doing electronics and hardware;
another one was hosted in the same place, but about science-fiction and fantasy books, that I was
'maintaining' for a book club I was a part of.

All that is around 8 years ago, several posts are lost as drafts, and no wish to write anything there
anymore, because it all seems too serious, and no fun.

I've gathered some motivation again to start posting stuff and do things simply and as much as possible,
self-hosted and created. I was an active twitter user in all this time I have missed updating my blog, and
I made many friends there, including my last boss, who I was friends with on twitter already befor working
in his company (electronut labs), but I had just stopped posting there as well few years ago - I can't really
say why exactly, but I stopped that, and my social trajectory also bent towards becoming a recluse for a
while. Now even if I don't want to be be same, I feel like I've just lost a lot of connections and it's
difficult to connect again.

So, in summary, this blog is an attempt to try an claim a small part of the internet, in hopes of making
connections.

In the status page (home) of this blog, I wrote this as the summary about this blog:

> Just working on [this blog](/blog/thisblog). I have not written a blog in a long time, and the previous blog which used jekyll was not really something I like.
So this one is purely static blog, no templates, nothing, just organic HTML, [htmx](https://htmx.org/), [zero-md](https://zerodevx.github.io/zero-md/), symbolic links and markdown content.
