# 'Should'

**Dated**: 2021/01/01

This is a word that has made me miserable in life. It is probably not very hard for most people to this.

- Adopting / internalizing external expectation as goals for self

- These "should" things are mostly not what you really want to do with your life in any case

- Example: you need to be at the top of your field, and also you should be making good money,
and you should be married before you turn 30, and you should own this set of things

The problem with these _shoulds_ that are not your own is that they will always devolve into more
'shoulds'. It's as if these are ghosts in your machine whispering to you these subliminal commands
which clash with who you really are. You cannot distinguish whether these desires are your own or
from something outside of you.

A more concrete example for this is you feeling a pressure to work on weekends; this could be for
your main job, your side project (whose aim is self-improvement, because it is something you consider
will help you in some way). This could be a good thing to do, or it could be something that makes you
feel terrible. If it is part of your plan to achieve something, good for you, probably a good thing.
_If your reasons for doing something are not your own, then perhaps it will end up creating an inner
conflict which affects your well being._

This is something I've learnt over the years and also something I've seen in others' lives; most of
us have to fight to be ourselves. Your parents, your peers, your idea of others, they all want you
to be something that you may not be.

If you're a man, you'll feel pressure to do things in your life in some way, which will influence who
you are. If you're a woman, you'll feel you need to be something else, or fall into certain roles. If
who are are falls outside of the norm, then I can only imagine the pressure and the anxiety.

One may not want to always be fightinh, be judged, forced to not be their authentic selves, but I've
found that for me, and for others, the only way to reduce or eliminate these pressures is to fight
it, and to make the world become used to you are. I like to call this the _"we don't negotiate with
the terrorists"_ strategy. It may sound strange, but the message is clear, when someone else tries to
pressurize, guilt trip, or otherwise use whatever their strategy is to make you fit some role, make
you feel unwelcome in some space where you have all rights to be in, you _do not give in_.

You do that 3 times, and maybe the 4th time, there won't be any resistance. This 'person' could be a
parent, sibling, your office, or raondos in a public space.

(this is an old draft I had. I like what this says, but I don't remember what the trigger was for
writing this)
