What I read in 2024
===================

**Dated**: 2025/01/08


Non-fiction
===========

### [Blood, Sweat, and Pixels](#blood-sweat-and-pixels-by-jason-schreier) (by Jason Schreier)

![](blood_sweat_pixels.png)

This books documents the behind the scenes of making several popular video games. The 10 games covered are recent-ish, certainly not retro in 2024, and I've played about half of them. This book talks covers mainly the entrepreneurial side of video game companies, and it was quite interesting for the games I'm familiar with (to me), but If I'm being honest, I had hoped this talked more about the technical and creative stuff that goes on in making those games.

The most interesting chapters in the book for me were those that covered small (sometimes single developer) games -- Pillars of eternity (maybe the first major crowd funded video game), Stardew valley (single developer, indie hit), Shovel knight (small indie team).

**Rating**: 3/5

### [The Secret Life of Fungi: Discoveries From a Hidden World](#the-secret-life-of-fungi-discoveries-from-a-hidden-world-by-aliya-whiteley) (by Aliya Whiteley)

![](mushrooms.png)

This was a short book about mushrooms and other fungi. It was informational, and I liked it I think it could be a starting point for someone who is interested in learning more about fungi -- they are super interesting and fun guys.

**Rating**: 3.5/5

### [The Soul of a New Machine](#the-soul-of-a-new-machine-by-tracy-kidder) (by Tracy Kidder)

![](soul-of-a-new-machine.png)

I loved this book, and I don't think I've ever read, seen or heard such detailed accounts of the goings-on in a tech company and between engineers. There have been several movies or shows which focus on the engineers during the silicon valley gold rush (and I've seen maybe a couple of them), but I don't think any of them have accounts like those presented in the book. It's vivid, and does not shy away from _really_ talking about the things that the engineers did, or struggled with, or what was really; same goes for what was going at the management and the interpersonal stuff between the employees at the company that Tracy spent a long time with.

A little background: the book was published in 1981, and the company that Tracy is documenting is 'Data General', a company that was making a new computer at the time. The company no longer exists just like many others at the time.

I highly recommend this book to any engineers who really want to know how it would have felt like at the time to be working on building a computer at such a place at such a time -- something like that is basically no longer possible, things are similar now, but also quite different.

**Rating**: 5/5

### [Coding Democracy](#coding-democracy-by-maureen-webb) (by Maureen Webb)

**Full name**: Coding Democracy: How a Growing Hacking Movement Is Disrupting Concentrations of Power, Mass Surveillance, and Authoritarianism

![](coding_democracy.png)

In this book, the author talks about how hackers and tech-activists are shaping our digital and real world. She also covers a lot of the history of important events, people and places where hacking/hackers and tech activism played a big role. For me, this book was a reminder for the things that should be making us concerned, angry, or sometimes even hopeful - from Wikileaks, Aaron Swartz, Bitcoin, to crypto-parties and hacker camps at CCC.

I really like this book, the author is really smart, and has covered a lot of ground talking to people and documenting the history and presenting the hacker ethic.

**Rating**: 5/5

### [Blood in the Machine](#blood-in-the-machine-by-brian-merchant) (by Brian Merchant)

**Full name**: Blood in the Machine: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech

![](luddite.png)

Review: Already reviewed [here](../book_luddite/).

**Rating**: 5/5

### [The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation](#the-internet-con-how-to-seize-the-means-of-computation-by-cory-doctorow) (by Cory Doctorow)

![](internet_con.png)

I had seen several talks by Cory, and have followed him on twitter (formerly twitter) / mastodon etc. for a long time, but somehow had never read a full book from him. Cory has worked as an activist for intellectual property with EFF among other things, and hates DRM, has coined the term [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification), and is an author (including of science fiction books).

Cory is a great explainer of tech babble and why some technologists are sometimes scared of things when non-tech-savvy or even most tech-savvy people might think 'what's the big deal?'. His writing is also very smart and very compelling in his writing about issues like DRM, copyright misuse, internet infrastructure, and he very clear in his positions regarding things like blockchain (which is mostly grifters). If you do not read/listen to this book (audiobook read by him), you should listen to this talk at least.

Fiction
=======

Covering only the ones I had some thoughts on.

## ***Horror / Weird fiction***

I tried to read more (or some) horror and weird fiction, and these are the highlights:

### **[We Have Always Lived in the Castle](#we-have-always-lived-in-the-castle-by-shirley-jackson)** (by Shirley Jackson)

![](always_castle.png)

From the PoV of a weird kid, very interesting, uneasy, 'gothic' novel that has some of the weirdness you would expect in a creepy mansion story with reclusive character.

**Rating**: 5/5

### **[All the Fiends of Hell](#all-the-fiends-of-hell-by-adam-lg-nevill)** (by Adam L.G. Nevill)

![](fiends_hell.png)

Horror, but very different, I think. It's almost an invasion story where most of humanity is just taken suddenly. Our main character is one of the few left because they were bed-ridden. I really enjoyed the book, but would have liked some answers.

**Rating**: 	4/5

### **[The Ballad of Black Tom](#the-ballad-of-black-tom-by-victor-lavalle)** (by Victor LaValle)

![](black_tom.png)

A short lovecraftian novella that's well written. The author is making a point about racism that is apparent in some of Lovecraft's writings by making it a central thing in the novel, and it works perfectly.

## ***Sci-fi / Fantasy***

### **[There Is No Antimemetics Division](#there-is-no-antimemetics-division-by-qntm)** (by qntm)

![](antimemetics.png)

I highly recommend this book (although you may want to wait for the edited and trad-pub version coming later in 2025) to anyone who remotely likes the [SCP foundation](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/), or the video game 'Control'.

**Rating**: 5/5

### **[Neuromancer](#neuromancer-by-william-gibson)** (by William Gibson)

![](neuromancer.png)

No wonder why it's considered a classic. It's very atmospheric, has great world-building, and is always vivid (which might be because imagery from this book has inspired so much media).

**Rating**: 5/5

### **[The Element of Fire](#the-element-of-fire-by-martha-wells)** (by Martha Wells)

![](element_fire.png)

I liked this book, except for a couple of plot points. I also wanted more world building, because what *was* in there was super interesting; I guess the sequels will have more.
If I have to compare it to something, I think if you like Riyria chronicles, you might like this one.

**Rating**: 4/5

### **[Double Star](#double-star-by-robert-a-heinlein)** (by Robert A. Heinlein)

![](double_star.png)

Great classic science fiction book that was not at all what I expected (I expected it to have something to do with two stars..). It's quite light on the science, and heavy on the pulp sci-fi, but very enjoyable and not at all cringey, which I think some classic books now are.

**Rating**: 4/5

### **[Legends & Lattes](#legends--lattes-by-travis-baldree)** (by Travis Baldree)

![](legends_latte.png)

I think this is the book that really popularized the cozy fantasy genre growth that we have right now. It was a nice easy read and I really liked and rooted for the characters. I had hoped for more conflict, but I still enjoyed it as there was still some tension and pull to read what happens next.

**Rating**: 4/5

### **[Shards of Earth](#shards-of-earth-by-adrian-tchaikovsky)** (by Adrian Tchaikovsky)

![](shards_time.png)

I have read Adrian's 'Children of time' book series, and I really loved at least 2 of them. They were hard sci-fi, and they were great. This one is different, it's a space opera, and while I did enjoy it in parts, overall, it did not click with me. 

**Rating**: 3/5
