# Book review: 'Blood in the machine' by Brian Merchant

**Dated**: 2024/11/24

I don't write long-form reviews of books, but I decided to write one for this book anyway
because it was real food for thought, and it was also one of my favourite books that I
read this year.

The book tells the real story behind who the luddites were and why they did the
things they did. Modern usage of the term 'luddite' has become a term used to label someone
as being scared of technology just because it is something new, but that is quite far away from
the whole story, tells nothing about the luddites' motivations, and completely eliminates
who they were revolting against (hint: it was not technology really).

The time period that this book mainly talks about is 1811-1816 (although not just this period),
as that is when the Luddite uprising happened and then was quashed.
I didn't particularly remember anything that happened during this time period, whether it's the
places the book takes you, or India or any other place, but, I did know about
["1816, The year without a summer"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0zWSg9gHv8)
from a song by the band Rasputina with the same name, and I also remember (due to the same
song) that Mary Shelley "had to stay inside, and she wrote Frankenstien" in the same year.

First off, this book was very engaging throughout. The author clearly mentions the references
he has used and what their credibility is, so you know when you should take things with a grain
of salt. The time period described in the book is right in the middle of the
[industrial revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution),
and it is really fascinating. This is a time period that I feel has been the setting of much
media, but maybe just as a backdrop, imagine England with sooty skies, cold winter, poverty,
child labor, factories, etc.  think a typical Dickensian novel. It's a common setting for a
lot of fiction (because it's a period of much change and also quite an easy setting for pain and
tragedy?), yet a new perspective about , and all the negatives that were
really innovated in this era (child labor, factories, factory towns, anti-unionization laws,
collusion, etc.). This period is not the only thing that the book talks about though; throughout
the book, the author is engaging with the reader to think about how modern tech giants are
doing the same things still, and to a much greater scale.

Skilled textile workers, who took pride in their work and had basic human dignity, were the ones
who had to take up hameers under the command of a fictional (mythical?) General Ludd, who was not
one person or a real person. At the time, the biggest trade from England was of textiles and clothes,
and the industry employed the second-largest chunk of the population after farming.
The use of certain newly invented machines that allowed unskilled workers (even children) to produce
fabrics and stockings etc., allowed the mill owners to significantly lower the wages, and made shoddier
clothes, all the while affecting a huge chunk of the population, which drove whole cities to poverty.
The government of course took the side of the industrialists and refused to intervene.

Those who called themselves the followers of Ludd took to smashing those machines, and until a certain
factory owner took to shooting the luddites, and them finally killing someone, the general opinion of
the commoners was favorable, something akin to the legend of Robin Hood. Many (interesting) things
happened; we see the perspective of several persons of different social classes in the book, from the
Luddites, and their friends/families to the kings's advisors, politicans and writers. One of note among
them was Lord Byron, then poet/politician, who apparantly was kind of a rock star of the time as much
as something like that existed then. He is described as someone who is rich, cannot really connect to
the luddites, who were significantly lower in the social strata than him, yet is a poet, who will
champion the oppressed and the underdog. He published several things in support of the luddites, some
criticizing the government and the industrialists, but in the end, his support was from far away,
while he would still consider the luddites to be far removed from his own social circle and did not
really understand or connect to them at all. The author says that his involvement in the cause was
similar to how a lot of liberal politics is these days, out of touch with the people being affected
by the things they argue about. Ultimately, Byron was somewhat helpful, as an outsider yet, and while
it did not change the outcome, it did make the luddites see a voice for them in the political circle
and may have created some sympathy for their cause.

This book puts into words very clearly the things we should talk about when we talk about machines,
robots, AI etc. coming to take over your jobs.

1. Luddites did not fear the machines; they were smart, used machines themselves, and knew exactly what
   the effect of those machines would be on their lives, and when the dam broke, they chose to do
   something about it.

2. It is not the machines that spontaneously appear and disrupt a whole industry and take over jobs.
   It's the companies, the CEOs, the managers that take decisions to do that.

3. It was this industrial revolution period that had the innovations of factories, employing children,
   bonded labor in workhouses, factory towns, and unions being bad. These things have lasted until now:
   some have been perfected, some made illegal.

4. The media always removes the mention of those that make the decisions for automation, or gig-ifying,
   etc. It's always "robots are coming for your job", or "gig work is good, actually". The only thing
   stopping these things from happening sooner is often laws and regulations; companies like Uber will
   find ways to bypass them.

I have a somewhat good idea of how I want to engage with the tech giants of today, even if it's not
always perfect. As a tech worker, I personally do not really foresee me being in a situation that
affects work overly suddenly in the foreseeable future, even with AI in the picture. I try to embrace
personal computing (even if not perfectly, and not enough according to many), which is made extremely
hard by these companies for things like your phone or how the internet has mostly become theirs;
social media, email, even blogs are all in a walled garden. I will not be able to explain well why
taking control of how we are able to use computers (_all_ of them) and the internet is important,
but I will put this paragraph from Cory Doctorow, from his book "The Internet Con: How to Seize the
Means of Computation":

   > These companies rule our digital world, the place where we find one another, form communities and 
   mobilize in solidarity to take collective action. Winning tech back isn’t more important than
   preventing runaway climate change or ending gender-based violence and discrimination, but it’s
   hard to imagine how we’ll do either—or anything else of significance—without digital infrastructure
   to hold us together. Fixing tech isn’t more important than fixing everything else, but unless we
   fix tech, we can forget about winning any of those other fights.

Sitting here, writing about these issues, from a distance does feel like a comparison to Byron would
apply to me and many others, perhaps, but then when you think about what Cory says, and think about
the hacker ethos - such kind of small resistance matters. Anyway, I'm not able to finish my concluding
thoughts in a good way, so I stop here.
