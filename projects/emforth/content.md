# emforth: a forth implemented in C

I've been fascinated by forth for a long time, and this is my attempt trying to bootstrap it in my own
mind. For some people, it may be a weekend project, but I have taken a shamefully long time, giving up
or forgetting about it for months, but finally I consider the 'core' to be mostly finished. Finally this
forth will run on an MCU, hopefully connected to a display and a keyboard to let you run forth code on.
