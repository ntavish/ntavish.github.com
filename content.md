**Hi!** You've reached my corner of the internet.<br>
This will be my "status" page and I will try to keep it updated with what I've been up to<br>

*Date*: 2024/07/01

Just working on [this blog](/blog/thisblog). I have not written a blog in a long time, and the previous blog which used jekyll was not really something I like.
So this one is purely static blog, no templates, nothing, just organic HTML, [htmx](https://htmx.org/), [zero-md](https://zerodevx.github.io/zero-md/), symbolic links and markdown content.
