### Step 1:
Create your kiosk application. Example would be say web app
running on the kiosk itself in php/python/nodejs etc.

#### Step 2:
Use some small distro, preferably with sysVinit(easy to edit 
`/etc/inittab` than writing upstart entries)

Example changes in `/etc/inittab`, comment out one of the tty logins:-
	{% highlight bash %}#1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 115200 tty1 {% endhighlight %}
Autologin:- 
	{% highlight bash %}1:2345:respawn:/bin/login -f user_name tty1 </dev/tty1 >/dev/tty1 2>&1{% endhighlight %}


Edit your `/etc/rc.local`  to startx:-
	{% highlight bash %}su -l user_name -c 'startx -e /usr/bin/browser http://localhost:9001 2>&1' {% endhighlight %}
(or you may use `~/.xinitrc`)

Or, install nodm, edit /etc/nodm to enable it and set user,
and edit user's `~/.xinitrc` to launch your app.


This way you are not launching any window manager, so no login
and your application is started automatically

##### Step 3:
Profit

This can be used with low powered linux running computers like
imx233-olinuxino with TV-out, or raspPi to make a really cheap
kiosk.

Or this can be setup with an old desktop which will still be 
cheap. Other possibilities are using a touchscreen interface,
or giving only mouse as user interface etc.

(Note: All this assumes you have drivers, configurations working for 
your display device, input devices and working Xorg.conf for display/input etc)
