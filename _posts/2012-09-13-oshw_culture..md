I think any CS/Electronics student should actually be interested in what
they are learning, and so should actually be tinkering with actual 
electronics. How to work with an oscilloscope should be a part of their 
basic toolset.

But it seems to me that how these courses are taught here
makes CS | Electronics two quite distinct subjects, which they are 
absolutely not. They are complimentary, or symbiotic or whatever. 
'Computer engineers' develop systems, and to do that you need to 
know stuff from several fields.

<incomplete thoughts>

This maker revolution seems to have started with arduino, with it as its
poster child. Arduino is an 8-bit AVR based microcontroller developed by
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino#Development_team, they created it
for non technically inclned students to get started with building
interactive stuff fast. They released all schematics, and sources to
people. It has now become probably the most popular microcontroller 
platform for beginners. Many derivative boards, or boards which aim to 
provide a simplified envoronment have come up since. 

Although don't think that this is the best in terms of price, or 
performance, or features. Its great to get started with it, but you 
not not be satisfied with only an 8-bit cotroller which gives you 
a kind of black box environmnet. You would possibly never need to 
even read the atmega datasheet to use much of the functionality 
of the AVR since most things have user/arduino made libraries available.
Nor should you be contnt with it, since there awaits a whole lot of different
architectures out there, ARMs from many manufacturers, PIC8/16/32, 
to strange multicore ones. Look a this for some help http://hackaday.com/2011/02/01/what-development-board-to-use/,
there's a part 2 too, find it yourself.

When you are finished with working with just plain absolute barebones code,
you can look into running an RTOS on your board. If you have something
capable of running
