TODO
----

* Object oriented design, a pipeline of data, small buffer say 64 samples for low latency

* High level 'boxes' like delay lines, biquads etc.

* Single threaded, blocking queue design. The pipeline is stalled when you saturate the output
  buffer. PA keeps 128-124 samples in buffer at a time.
