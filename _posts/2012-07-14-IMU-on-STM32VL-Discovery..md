title: IMU on STM32VL-Discovery
category: projects
---

I had previously built an IMU implementation on an arduino (processing
onboard(not satisfactory), or on a real computer). It was actually based on
[Sebastian Madgwick's](http://www.x-io.co.uk/node/8) Ph.D research. I was 
actually working on a kalman filter based algorithm for inertial measurement
when his paper was made available online thrugh IEEE. It was easy to understand,
easy to implement, fast and had good results. (And he was kind enough to put up 
a C implementation of his algorithm). So the only logical step for me was to 
use his work and then feel bad later about not doing anything significant.

To be continued...
